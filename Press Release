#Have Your Say! Municipal Voting Made Easy by WR Civic Tech 
Municipal elections generally have low voter turn out and WR Civic Tech is working to change that! A dedicated group of local volunteers have come together to make a one stop voting information spot. 
Often people don’t vote municipally because they don’t know where to go to find information on the candidates or don’t know how municipal governance affects their daily lives. The reality is, municipal government has more impact on how the cities are shaped, than provincial or federal governments do.
Parks, garbage collection, safe injection sites, shelters, bike lanes, are only a few of the matters managed by municipal government. There is no more need to become overwhelmed with the amount of information or the complexities of voting municipally. WR Civic Tech has done all the work for you! We have compiled candidate listings, websites, event listings, news articles, contact information, anything we could get our hands on, and put it in one, easy to navigate website: waterlooregionvotes.org. All you have to do is click to learn everything you need to know to make an informed decision.
“This is an amazing tool to find out what candidates think on issues I’m concerned about” said (someone who read our website). “I didn’t realise there are so many people I can vote for to have a say in what is happening in my city.” 
The municipal election is October 22nd. Have your say and vote!
