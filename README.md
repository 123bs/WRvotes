# WRvotes

## Overview
Encourage greater municipal election participation through candidacy, campaign volunteership and increased voter turnout.   

## Goals
1.  Identify wards with low historic (2014) candidate participation
    -  *Why?* Help people identify where they should get active as candidates, before nominations (from May 1-July 27)
    -  Note: Donâ€™t advantage incumbents by identifying names.
    -  *What to answer:*  How do I run?
2.  Map voter turnout by ward within Waterloo Region
    -  Why? Help candidates and volunteers (initially) figure out where they can best apply their resources in community outreach.
3.  Create a platform for community access to basic candidate information (who, where, links to other info)
4.  Inform the community on debates/all candidate meetings
5.  Get out the vote on October 22
