## CivicTechWR builds WaterlooRegionVotes.org to encourage voter engagement

A dedicated group of local volunteers have come together to make **https://WaterlooRegionVotes.org**, a one stop voting information spot. With this helpful website, it will be easy to get engaged with the Waterloo Region municipal election on October 22, 2018.

Voter turnout [is lower](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-640-x/2009001/tab/tab3-1-eng.htm) in municipal elections than for any other level of government in Canada. Many people we've spoken with say they struggle with municipal elections because they don’t know where to go to find information on the candidates or don’t understand how municipal governance affects their daily lives. The reality is municipal government is vitally important, and has more impact on how cities and townships are shaped than other levels of government.  Parks, garbage collection, safe injection sites, shelters, and bike lanes are only a few of the matters managed by municipal government. Even though municipal elections are important, all too often they are ignored. 

WaterlooRegionVotes.org has compiled candidate listings, events, news articles, and more into one easy to navigate website.  Learning about the election and making an informed decision is one click away. Voters no longer have to feel overwhelmed by the complexities of voting municipally. Users can also contribute municipal election content they discover to make the site better.

*“I've always considered voting to be the most basic of civic duties, but it's not straighforward to keep track of all of the different offices and candidates in municipal elections. In 2014, I remember making it to the polling station, thinking I was ready to make an informed vote, only to discover that one of the positions was a 'choose two.'”* said Kristina Taylor.
