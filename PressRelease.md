## CivicTechWR builds waterlooregionvotes.org to promote voter engagement

A dedicated group of local volunteers have come together to make **https://waterlooregionvotes.org**, a one stop voting information spot. With this helpful website, it will be easy to get engaged with the Waterloo Region municipal election.

Often people don’t vote municipally because they don’t know where to go to find information on the candidates or don’t know how municipal governance affects their daily lives. The reality is municipal government is vitally important, and has more impact on how cities and townships are shaped than other levels of government.  Parks, garbage collection, safe injection sites, shelters, and bike lanes are only a few of the matters managed by municipal government. Even though municipal elections are important, all too often they are ignored. waterlooregionvotes.org aims to fix that.

waterlooregionvotes.org has compiled candidate listings, events, news articles, and more into one easy to navigate website.  Learning about the election and making an informed decision is one click away. Voters no longer have to feel overwhelmed by the complexities of voting municipally.

*“This is an amazing tool to find out what candidates think on issues I’m concerned about”* said (someone who read our website). *“I didn’t realise there are so many people I can vote for to have a say in what is happening in my city.”*

### The municipal election is October 22nd. Have your say and vote!
